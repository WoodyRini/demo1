MetaGamer Project
=====

This is a pet project from summer 2013 that I occasionally work on. It simulates a playing card tournament with swiss rounds
by pitting different decks against each other. I intend to use it to simulate results for Magic: The Gathering tournament,
but I suppose it could be used for any card tournament with the same format.
